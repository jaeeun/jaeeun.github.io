# SketchUp for Remodeling

3D house for remodeling using SketchUp, free version.
It was a very useful simulation for me.
I can try to move and arrange some furniture in the simulation as I imagine.
Also, I can help the interior designer understand my plan.
To check in detail, I just give him the captured image of the SketchUp.
